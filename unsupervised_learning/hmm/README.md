The Markov property refers to a stochastic process where the future state of the system depends only on its current state and not on the sequence of events that preceded it.

A Markov chain is a mathematical model used to describe a sequence of events or states where the Markov property holds, meaning that the future state depends only on the current state. It's often used in probability theory and statistics to model various processes.

In a Markov chain, a "state" represents a specific condition or situation of the system being modeled.

A transition probability or matrix in the context of a Markov chain specifies the probability of moving from one state to another in a single step.

A "stationary state" (also called a steady-state or equilibrium state) is a state in which the probabilities of being in each state remain constant over time, meaning the Markov chain has reached a stable distribution.

A "regular Markov chain" is one in which all states can eventually reach each other with positive probability.

To determine if a transition matrix is regular, you can check if the matrix's powers (e.g., matrix raised to the power of n) have all positive entries for some positive integer n.

An "absorbing state" in a Markov chain is a state from which it is impossible to leave once entered.

A "transient state" is a state in which you can leave and may never return to.

A "recurrent state" is a state in which you will eventually return to with probability 1.

An "absorbing Markov chain" is a Markov chain in which there is at least one absorbing state, and from any initial state, there is a non-zero probability of reaching an absorbing state.

A "Hidden Markov Model (HMM)" is a statistical model used in various applications, such as speech recognition and bioinformatics, where you have observable data (observations) influenced by an underlying, unobservable state sequence (hidden states).

A "hidden state" in an HMM represents an unobservable underlying state that influences the observed data.

An "observation" in the context of an HMM refers to the data or evidence you can observe or measure.

An "emission probability/matrix" in an HMM specifies the probability of observing a particular data point given a particular hidden state.

A "Trellis diagram" is a graphical representation used to visualize the computations involved in various algorithms for HMMs, such as the Forward, Viterbi, and Forward-Backward algorithms.

The "Forward algorithm" in HMMs is used to compute the probability of observing a particular sequence of data points given the model. It is implemented through dynamic programming.

"Decoding" in the context of HMMs refers to the process of finding the most likely sequence of hidden states given a sequence of observations.

The "Viterbi algorithm" is an efficient method for finding the most likely sequence of hidden states (decoding) in an HMM. It also utilizes dynamic programming.

The "Forward-Backward algorithm" is used to compute the posterior probabilities of hidden states at each time step given a sequence of observations in an HMM. It combines forward and backward passes and is used in tasks like training HMMs.

The "Baum-Welch algorithm" is an iterative algorithm used to train the parameters (transition and emission probabilities) of an HMM from a given set of observations. It's based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework.
