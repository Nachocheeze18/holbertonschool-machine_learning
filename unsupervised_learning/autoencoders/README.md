An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network designed for unsupervised learning that compresses input data into a lower-dimensional representation and then attempts to reconstruct the original data from this representation.

Latent space refers to the compressed, lower-dimensional representation of data created by an autoencoder, where meaningful features and patterns are captured, enabling data generation or analysis.

A bottleneck in the context of autoencoders refers to the layer or part of the network where the dimensionality reduction occurs, typically the layer with fewer neurons, forcing the network to learn a compact representation.

A sparse autoencoder is a variation of the autoencoder that enforces sparsity in the latent representation, meaning only a small subset of neurons in the representation layer are active at a time.

A convolutional autoencoder is a type of autoencoder specifically designed for processing and generating images, using convolutional neural network layers for feature extraction and reconstruction.

A generative model is a type of machine learning model that learns to generate data, often used in applications like image synthesis or text generation.

A variational autoencoder (VAE) is a generative model that combines probabilistic and neural network techniques to learn a probabilistic mapping between input data and a latent space, allowing for controlled and structured data generation.

The Kullback-Leibler divergence, often denoted as KL divergence, is a measure of how one probability distribution differs from a second, typically used in the context of variational autoencoders to measure the difference between the learned latent distribution and a predefined target distribution.
