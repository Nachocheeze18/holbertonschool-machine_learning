Bayesian Probability:
Bayesian probability, or Bayesian inference, is a framework for updating beliefs or making probabilistic predictions based on both prior knowledge and new evidence. It's named after Thomas Bayes, an 18th-century statistician and theologian. In Bayesian probability, we start with a prior probability distribution that represents our initial beliefs or uncertainty about a particular event or parameter. As new evidence becomes available, we update our beliefs using Bayes' rule to obtain a posterior probability distribution that incorporates both our prior beliefs and the new data.

Bayes' Rule (Bayesian Inference):
Bayes' rule is a fundamental theorem in Bayesian probability that mathematically describes how to update our beliefs (the posterior probability) about an event or parameter based on new evidence. The formula for 
P(B) is the probability of observing evidence B.
To use Bayes' rule, you start with an initial belief (the prior) and then update it based on new evidence (the likelihood) to obtain a revised belief (the posterior).

Base Rate:
The base rate, often referred to as the prior probability or base rate probability, represents the initial probability or belief in an event before considering any specific evidence or data. It provides a context for understanding the likelihood of an event occurring without taking any new information into account. Base rates are important in Bayesian probability because they serve as a starting point for updating beliefs using Bayes' rule.

Prior:
In Bayesian probability, the prior is the initial probability distribution that represents your beliefs or knowledge about a particular event or parameter before considering any new evidence. It encapsulates your prior beliefs or uncertainty. The prior serves as the starting point for Bayesian updating, where it is combined with the likelihood to calculate the posterior probability.

Posterior:
The posterior probability, or simply the posterior, is the updated probability distribution that reflects your beliefs about an event or parameter after considering new evidence. It is calculated using Bayes' rule and incorporates both the prior probability and the likelihood of the evidence. The posterior represents your revised beliefs or knowledge based on the available data.

Likelihood:
The likelihood is a probability distribution that describes the probability of observing specific evidence or data given a particular hypothesis or event. In Bayesian inference, it quantifies how well the evidence supports a specific hypothesis or parameter value. The likelihood is an essential component of Bayes' rule, as it informs how the prior probability should be updated in light of the new evidence. It measures the compatibility between the observed data and the hypothesis under consideration.
