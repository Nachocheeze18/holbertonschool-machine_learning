# Time Series Forecasting
Time series forecasting is a crucial aspect of data analysis that involves predicting future values based on historical data points arranged in chronological order. It finds applications in various domains such as finance, weather prediction, and resource planning.

# Stationary Process
A stationary process is a key concept in time series analysis. A time series is considered stationary if its statistical properties, such as mean and variance, remain constant over time. Stationarity simplifies the modeling process and helps in making more accurate predictions.

# Sliding Window
A sliding window is a technique used in time series analysis to process data sequentially. It involves moving a fixed-size window across the time series data, updating the window at each step. This method is particularly useful for feature extraction and creating subsets of data for analysis.

# Preprocessing Time Series Data
Effective preprocessing is essential for accurate time series forecasting. Common preprocessing steps include handling missing values, normalizing data, and dealing with outliers. Proper preprocessing ensures that the data is suitable for training machine learning models.
