# How to use Transformers for Machine Translation:
Install the Transformers library using pip install transformers.
Import necessary libraries: from transformers import MarianMTModel, MarianTokenizer.
Load a pre-trained model: model = MarianMTModel.from_pretrained("Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-de").
Tokenize and translate: Use the tokenizer and model to translate input text.

## How to write a custom train/test loop in Keras:
Define a Keras model using Sequential or Functional API.
Compile the model with an optimizer, loss function, and metrics.
Write custom training and testing steps using tf.GradientTape for training and model.evaluate for testing.
Iterate through epochs and batches, applying the custom training and testing steps.

## How to use TensorFlow Datasets:
Install TensorFlow and TensorFlow Datasets using pip install tensorflow tensorflow-datasets.
Provide example usage in Python, importing tensorflow and tensorflow_datasets.
Load a dataset using tfds.load with relevant parameters (e.g., name, split, shuffle_files).
Preprocess the dataset as needed (e.g., using map).
Build, compile, and train a model on the dataset.
Include relevant code snippets and adjust the instructions based on the specific dataset and task.
