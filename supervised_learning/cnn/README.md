A convolutional layer in a CNN applies learnable filters to the input data, extracting local patterns or features.
A pooling layer downsamples the input, reducing spatial dimensions and retaining important features.
Forward propagation passes the input through convolutional and pooling layers, applying filters and pooling operations.
Backpropagation calculates gradients and updates parameters, distributing gradients through pooling and applying convolutions in reverse.
To build a CNN using TensorFlow and Keras, define the model, add convolutional and pooling layers, flatten the output, add fully connected layers, compile, train, evaluate, and make predictions.
